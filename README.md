# Grain

Show a language model what it's like to be you by effortlessly fetching, processing, and uploading your data to the R2R for personalized content generation through RAG.

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER** ⚠️

This project is a work in progress with big plans to expand in the future. The current implementation is tailored to my personal use and may not cover all potential use cases or be fully optimized. Use at your own risk and stay tuned for upcoming updates and improvements!

## Overview

What if we could show a language model what it's like to be us? What if we could provide it with a comprehensive dataset of our digital lives to help it understand our thoughts, feelings, and experiences? This is the vision behind Grain.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a tool that can fetch, process, and upload everything we read, write, say, hear, and do to the R2R system. This includes iMessages, notes, emails, and more. By providing a rich and diverse dataset, we can help the language model better understand our lives and experiences, enabling it to generate more personalized and relevant content.

This is a lofty goal. This iteration of Grain is not without its weaknesses. We're still limited by the capabilities of the language model and the quality of the data we provide. However, by taking the first step and building a tool to fetch, process, and upload our digital data, we can start to make this vision a reality.

Grain is powered by [R2R](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R), an extremely powerful and well-rounded RAG engine that is highly configurable. Most of all, it is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. By leveraging R2R, we can focus on building the data pipeline and leave the heavy lifting to the amazing work done by the R2R team.
